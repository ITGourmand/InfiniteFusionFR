# Pokemon Infinite Fusion FR (PIFFR)

## Pokemon Infinite Fusion FR  (PIFFR) is a fork of Infinite Fusion, which mean that it's a clone of this game but with all dialogue in French!

Pokemon Infinite Fusion FR (PIFFR) is community based and community driven, it is created by the community, for the French community, allowing each of us to easily help make a better French version of Infinite Fusion and have a better overall experience for the French.

The original Pokemon Infinite Fusion (PIF) has been created by Chardub/Frogman, using Pokemon Essential.

Pokemon Infinite Fusion FR (PIFFR) is standalone, meaning you do not need Pokemon Infinite Fusion (PIF) and you should NOT install PIFFR over a PIF game.

Remember that the backbone of PIFFR (which is the PIF) is still developed and maintained by Chardub/Frogman. If the PIF is stopped, it is very likely that PIFFR will be stopped as well.

This Github allows you to see the game (open-source), but also to contribute to the development of this project with pull-requests, and download the latest release to stay up-to-date.
